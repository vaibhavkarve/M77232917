# This is a project to look at some basic statistical properties of the 50th
# known Mersenne prime M77232917.

Things I looked at:
- Length of the prime
- Number of occurences of each digit
- Mean, and rolling mean (with different window sizes)
- Autocorrelation (or lack thereof)
- Longest string of repeated digits (found a string of ten 9's)
